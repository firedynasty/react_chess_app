  1. generate_preloaded_chess.py - A Python script that:
  - Reads all .txt and .md files from ./preloaded_reports/
  - Generates ./preloaded/index.json (file list with metadata)
  - Generates ./preloaded/reports.json (all file contents)

  2. Added "Preloaded Reports" button to the UI (blue button) that:
  - Fetches the preloaded JSON files
  - Loads them into window.loadedReportFiles (same format as "Select Reports
   Folder")
  - Opens the report files modal
  - Shows the count and "View Reports" button

  Usage:
  # When you add/change reports in ./preloaded_reports/, regenerate:
  python generate_preloaded_chess.py

  # Then serve the app and click "Preloaded Reports" button

  The preloaded reports work exactly like selecting a folder manually -
  clicking any report in the modal loads it the same way.


so I copy from chess/notes/reports/ to ./preloaded_reports so that it will load that as a button
