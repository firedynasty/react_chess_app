011726 Updates

1. Added navigation after pasting moves as variation
   - File: index.html (lines 2500-2514)
   - After using addMovesAsVariation() to paste moves like "33. Qf3 Rg4 34. Kh1", the board now automatically navigates to the move where the variation starts
   - Matches the behavior of the Stockfish variation adder
   - Uses jumpToNode() to navigate to the target move so user can click "Next Var." to enter the variation

2. UI improvement: Edit/View toggle button text
   - File: index.html (line 5725)
   - Changed button text from "View only" to "Go back to View Only" for better clarity
