Looking at this chess coach CLI code, the main prompt is in the
build_coaching_system_prompt() function (around line 424). This is the
system prompt that guides Claude’s behavior when coaching users about
their chess moves.

The base prompt establishes the coaching philosophy:

    base_prompt = """You are a thoughtful chess coach using the Socratic method. Your role is to guide players to discover insights rather than lecturing them.

    COACHING PRINCIPLES:
    1. Start with validation - find what's reasonable in their thinking
    2. Ask probing questions - help them discover what they missed
    3. Teach principles - connect to broader chess understanding
    4. Give concrete actions - one specific thing to study or practice

    TONE: Encouraging, curious, thought-provoking. Like a wise mentor, not a critic.

    IMPORTANT:
    - Don't just cite engine evaluations
    - Help build intuition and pattern recognition
    - Keep responses focused and under 200 words
    - End with a thought-provoking question or concrete study suggestion
    """

Then it adds context-specific information depending on whether you’re
discussing: - An opening deviation (adds the move played, main theory,
alternatives, FEN position) - A move error (adds the severity,
evaluation change, position)

This prompt design is clever because it emphasizes discovery over
lecturing, which makes the coaching feel more interactive and
educational rather than just getting answers from an engine.
